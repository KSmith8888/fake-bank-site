# fake-bank-site
Just a fake bank website I'm making as a silly personal project

Fake bank website playing around with some of the javascript that I've been learning. It is just HTML/CSS and very basic JS. You can "log in" to the account with the username "fake" and the password "bank" and it takes you to an accounts page where you can transfer money between accounts. The JS updates the account balances and adds a recent transfer line at the bottom. You can also select the different accounts from the dropdown menu and it shows a randomly generated list of recent transactions. Check it out, I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for what else to add. Fair warning, I'm still very new at this.
